In this dataset, we have identified multiple potential issues that could ultimately impact our analysis and modeling:

1. **Missing Data:** Columns like “Sched Type” and “Primary Instructor” contain missing values, which may bias or misrepresent trends that we find and could lead to an incomplete analysis. Some solutions could include removing rows with missing values or computing them based on similar data points.  
2. **Sparse Data:** Certain grade categories, particularly those at the extremes (like A+ and F), have low counts, leading to sparse data. Sparse data can interfere with reliable statistical analysis or model accuracy, since lower-frequency categories are underrepresented. To address this, we could consider aggregating similar categories or applying other smoothing techniques.  
3. **Imbalanced Data:** The grade distribution analysis reveals a higher frequency of A grades, indicating an imbalance. This bias may affect interpretations, making it appear as if the overall student performance is skewed toward higher grades. However, this skew may be an important characteristic of the data that our model should capture, as it reflects real trends in student performance. Therefore, we may choose to retain this aspect of the data instead of removing it entirely.
