**The problem:**  
As part of this project, we are trying to build a tool that allows the university to determine which courses require more recruitment/funding and allows students to determine which classes they might want to take or avoid. This is done by using historical data found in [The University of Illinoisâ€™ GPA Dataset](https://github.com/wadefagen/datasets/tree/master/gpa) for each course to determine what the grade distribution in upcoming semesters would be.
